# JavaScript linker / builder comparison of 2021

I felt out of touch of the linker / builder scene. Always just using Webpack.

Decided to take a deep dive and enlighten colleagues about what I found. This repo is the result.

## Participants

### Webpack

De facto.

### Parcel

I tried this a couple years back. Didn't impress me much.

### Snowpack

Heard about it a lot lately.

### ESBuild

This is supposed to be frigging fast!

### Rollup

Decided to exclude Rollup after reading a bit. I've used Rollup in NPM
package maintaining, this is a different use case and the stuff I found
pointed to the direction that Rollup w/ frontend builds is a kludge.
